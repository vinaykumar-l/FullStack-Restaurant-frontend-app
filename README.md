![ChatGPT-3 Landing Page](/path/to/screenshot.png)

Welcome to the ChatGPT-3 Landing Page repository! This project aims to showcase the capabilities and functionalities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-based language model, known as ChatGPT-3. The landing page is built using React, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with ChatGPT-3 and experience its natural language processing powers.

## Demo

A live demo of the ChatGPT-3 Landing Page is available at [https://your-demo-url.com](https://your-demo-url.com).

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can easily engage in natural language conversations with ChatGPT-3.
- **Real-time Responses:** Experience quick and responsive replies from the language model.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Tailor your conversational prompts to explore different use cases.
- **User-friendly Design:** The landing page is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing.

## Getting Started

To run this landing page locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChatGPT3-Landing-Page.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ChatGPT3-Landing-Page
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Obtain your OpenAI API key from [https://openai.com](https://openai.com) and create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add the API key to the `.env` file using the following format:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

6. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to interact with ChatGPT-3.

## How it Works

The ChatGPT-3 Landing Page leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model through the OpenAI API. When a user inputs a prompt through the chat interface, the application sends the request to the API, which processes the text and generates a response. The response is then displayed in real-time on the interface.
